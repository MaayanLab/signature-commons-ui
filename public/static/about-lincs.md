The [Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)](https://lincsproject.org/) program was an NIH Common Fund program aimed to catalog the response of human cells to chemical, genetic, microenvironment, and other perturbations using a wide array of assays. The LINCS consortium was organized into [six Data and Signature Generation Centers (DSGCs)](https://ldp3.cloud/#/DSGCs) who generated a diverse collection of cellular response signatures, and a [Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)](https://lincs-dcic.org/) who was established to address the challenge of integrating these datasets by developing data standards, analysis pipelines and tools, as well as platforms for consolidating and hosting LINCS data. Here we introduce LINCS Data Portal 3.0 (LDP3, https://ldp3.cloud), developed by the LINCS DCIC as a web portal for serving and querying the most recent and final LINCS datasets and signatures. LDP3 utilizes the backbone of [Signature Commons](https://github.com/MaayanLab/Sigcom-Tutorial), a cloud-agnostic platform designed to host diverse biomedical data with the focus on hosting searchable signatures. LDP3 provides a rapid [signature similarity search](https://ldp3.cloud/#/SignatureSearch/Rank) engine to query over 1 million LINCS signatures for mimickers and reversers. Additionally, users of LDP3 can perform [metadata search](https://ldp3.cloud/#/MetadataSearch/Signatures) using a full-text search to locate datasets, signatures, genes, and drugs. LDP3 is [findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)](https://fairshake.cloud/) compliant with metadata linked to standard ontologies and vocabularies. Furthermore, all data and signatures within LDP3 are available for download and [well-documented API](https://ldp3.cloud/#/API) access. Overall, LDP3 provides the next generation and final access to the data produced by the LINCS program.
