# Abstract

The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program is a national consortium funded by the NIH Common Fund to catalog human cell responses to chemical, genetic, and disease perturbations using a wide array of assay technologies. This resulted in the LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers (DSGCs) generating a diverse collection of cellular response signatures. The Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) has addressed the challenge of integrating these datasets by developing data standards, pipelines, and platforms for consolidating and hosting LINCS data. Here we introduce [LINCS Data Portal 3.0](https://ldp3.cloud), a web portal for serving and querying LINCS datasets and signatures. We built this web application using Signature Commons, a cloud-agnostic platform designed to host diverse biomedical data. The portal provides a signature similarity search to query for mimicker or reverser signatures in real time. Additionally, users can perform a global metadata search using the full-text search functionality. LINCS Data Portal 3.0 (LDP3) contains extensive metadata curated with existing vocabularies. Furthermore, expanding beyond the previous iterations of the data portal, we reworked the signatures in LDP3 using the characteristic direction method. The complete collection of LINCS datasets and signatures is available for download in LDP3.
