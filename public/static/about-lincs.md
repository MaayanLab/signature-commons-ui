The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH Common Fund program that catalogs the response of human cells to variouschemical, genetic, and disease perturbations. These large-scale perturbation-response signatures are openly available to the public through a series of data releases. Here, we introduce Signature Commons (SigCom), a cloud-agnostic platform for deploying, serving, and querying biomedical data that complies with the FAIR data principles. The  [SigCom-LINCS portal](https://maayanlab.cloud/sigcom-lincs) serves datasets from  the  six LINCS Data  and  Signature  Generation Centers (DSGCs). SigCom-LINCS is composed of a couple of microservices that communicate with each other to provide the users with a seamless experience. The metadata API provides fast full-text search and field comparison filtering of the metadata as well as metadata aggregations for statistical summaries. Furthermore, JSON-Schema validation is performed before ingestion to maintain the integrity of the database and ensure harmonizing the terms with existing ontologies. The data API, on the other hand, provides real-time two-sided ranked set-enrichment analysis. SigCom-LINCS includes OpenAPI documentation for these two microservices. A companion web application uses these APIs to provide a data portal for querying, browsing, downloading, and visualizing data.
